# TriviaApp

## Overview of Assignment:
Create a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. I chose the more difficult version of the game which required a timer on each trivia question. It also needed to be designed with valid HTML and CSS. I based the game on my favorite podcast YANSS (You are not so smart!!)
